        <button id="battle" *ngIf="battleTimevalid> 
        turn on once both are valid (two different booleans to turn on)


Rankings ('/rankings')
    Should have its own storage model of players once they battle 
    just take each user and it to the rankings model array

    loop through stored player/users and order by score 
    scroll bar?

Results   ('/results')
    redirected from battle after they clicked battle
    Display the winners picture on div on left (inline)
    display the scores and name in a div on the left (inline)
