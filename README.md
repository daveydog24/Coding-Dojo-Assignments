# Coding-Dojo-Assignments

This is my repository for all my assignment POST GRADUATION.

Its meant to show off my new skills that I learned throughout school. 

It is mostly to form a more organized file system without sporadic file naming and a better overall structure within assignments.

Complete with comments and more styling.
